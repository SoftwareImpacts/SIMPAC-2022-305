# PeyeMMV: Python implementation of EyeMMV’s fixation detection algorithm
Copyright (C) 2022 Vassilios Krassanakis (University of West Attica)

PeyeMMV constitutes a Python module that implements the two-step spatial dispersion fixation detection algorithm imported in both EyeMMV and LandRate MATLAB toolboxes. Specifically, this algorithm implements spatiotemporal criteria, belongs to the family of I-DT based algorithms and can be used as a spatial noise filtering approach during fixation identification process. PeyeMMV module could be utilized in order to extract fixation clusters among raw gaze data as well as to generate a basic plot that visualizes both gaze data and fixation centers positions. The module could be easily imported in every Python script or module.

The folder “DEMO” includes demo data as well as two different examples that show how PeyeMMV can be executed.
